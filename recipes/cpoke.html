    <p>I love Poke Bowls so much. But, whenever I go 
        to a restaurant and get them, I end up paying up 
        to $20 for my order, which is ridiculous. Well, 
        this poke-inspired chicken bowl is just what I need.</p>

            <li>In a container, add the chicken, along with the Ingredients
                for the marinade: soy sauce, mirin/rice vinegar, sesame oil,
                green onion, and garlic. Mix until the chicken is thoroughly
                coated, and let marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes,
                sealed.
            </li>
            <li>Cook the chicken on medium heat until tender, and fully cooked.
                <strong>Be careful not to burn the soy sauce.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Follow the package instructions to cook the rice in a pot, or
                just use a rice cooker to get it perfect effortlessly. <em>(please just
                buy a rice cooker)</em>
            </li>
            <li>Season cooked rice with rice vinegar, and a pinch of salt. The rice
                is now ready to use.
            </li>
            <li>Thinly slice your carrots into even batons. Place them in a sealable jar,
                and top with a mixture of equal parts water, and vinegar, along with salt
                to taste. <em>These can be refrigerated until use.</em>
            </li>
            <li>Slice your cucumber into even pieces. Set aside until use</li>
            <li>Cook your peas on medium heat in a pan until they appear bright green
                and slightly softened. Don't overcooked them!
            </li>
            <li>Lay out a bed of rice in a bowl</li>
            <li>Add all of your ingredients on top of your rice, dividing them into 
                separate parts. <em>Optionally you can top with cilantro, sesame seeds, and
                green onion.</em>
            </li>
        </ol>
