    <h2>Instructions / Steps</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend the flour, active
             dry yeast, and salt. Add the water and, with a wooden
              spoon or your hands, mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel
                 and allow it to rise at room temperature for 18 hours 
                 or until it has more than doubled. It will take longer
                  in a chilly room and less time in a very warm one.</li>
            <li>Flour a work surface and scrape out the dough. Divide it 
                into 4 equal parts and shape them. For each portion, start
                with the right side of the dough and pull it towards the 
                center; then do the same with the left, then the top, then 
                the bottom (the order doesn’t actually matter; what you want
                is four folds). Shape each portion into a round and turn
                seam side down. Mold the dough into a neat circular mound.
                The mounds should not be sticky; if they are, dust with
                more flour.</li>
            <li>If you don’t intend to use the dough right away, wrap the balls 
                individually in plastic and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Return
                to room temperature by leaving them out on the counter, covered
                in a damp cloth, for 2 to 3 hours before needed.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Pizza Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by heating olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Then add some
                 roughly cut garlic and saute for one minute. Add some red pepper
                  flakes and let those cook for about 10-15 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add a 28-ounce can of whole San Marzano tomatoes. Stir in and lightly
                 break up the tomatoes. Add some dry onion powder along with some dry
                  oregano, stir to combine and let simmer for 30-45 minutes. </li>
            <li>Add sauce to a blender and puree for about 10-15 seconds. </li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Pizza Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slowly start to pat the dough down into the general shape of a pizza.
                 Don’t roll it out with a rolling pin. Once the dough had grown in size,
                 pass over your knuckles and slowly start to spread it out until a pizza
                  pie shape is formed. </li>
            <li>Add your sauce and low moisture mozzarella along with whatever toppings
                 you’d like and place on your pizza stone in your preheated 500°F oven 
                 (pre-heat for 1 hour). Bake for 7-9 minutes. </li>
            <li>Let cool for a few minutes. Serve and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Calzone Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread sauce on half of your pizza and top with cheese and toppings of your choice.</li>
            <li>Fold the dough over on itself and crimp closed with a fork.</li>
            <li>Brush down with a little olive oil and place in a 500°F oven for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cool, serve and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
