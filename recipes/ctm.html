    <h2>Instructions / Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; 
                let marinate for 10 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken
                 pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned
                  for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking
                   the chicken in the sauce.)</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in the same pan. Fry the onions until soft (about 3 minutes) while
                 scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. </li>
            <li>Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add garam masala,
                 cumin, turmeric and coriander. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring
                 occasionally.</li>
            <li>Pour in the tomato puree, chili powders and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, 
                stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.</li>
            <li>Stir the cream and sugar through the sauce. Add the chicken and its juices back into 
                the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and
                 the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in the water to thin out the sauce, if needed.</li>
            <li>Garnish with cilantro (coriander) and serve with hot garlic butter rice and fresh homemade
                 Naan bread!</li>
